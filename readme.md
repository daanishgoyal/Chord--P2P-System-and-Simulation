### To run:

    `dotnet fsi Program.fsx numNodes numReq`
    
    
    
Implemented the network join and routing as described in the Chord paper using Actor Modeling (AKKA Framework) and it prints the average number of hops that have to be traversed to deliver a message.


##### Project was working for 1000 nodes with 5 requests each, So total requests generated= 50000.
